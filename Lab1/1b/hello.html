    <p>Hello World</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.uwb.edu/news/september-2022/my-story-a-note-to-self">
        <p>Of all the things I have survived, the deadliest foe I would overcome to sit writing on this quiet, sunny day
            was no fire, no angry man with a gun, no critical illness. It was me. I have survived me. </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>My plan was always to overdose. I have too many times witnessed violent death, and I will not bring that sorrow
        on others as I make my exit. I have had the means and opportunity, coupled with a fierce craving to die. I well
        remember performing my duties as an emergency room nurse with the thought intruding again and again, “I want to
        die.” But something always stayed my hand. Something kept me alive. </p>
    <p>That is my story, and that is the rope I would throw you, but you must get pissed off and climb it.
        You simply
        must know that somewhere in the universe somebody must be held to account for our pain. You must stand and fight
        your own demons. There is simply no other way. </p>
